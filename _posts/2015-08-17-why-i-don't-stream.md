Streaming services have taken over the way we all consume media these days. 

It started with <a href="http://netflix.com" target="_blank">Netflix</a> letting us watch thousands of movies on demand without having to leave our home. Better yet, we didn&rsquo;t have to worry if a movie was in stock at our local Blockbuster or returning it the next day to avoid more fees. No, for less than $8 a month we had unlimited possibilites anywhere and everywhere.

It&rsquo;s not surprising the music industry followed suit. <a href="http://pandora.com" target="_blank">Pandora Radio</a> was all the rage at first, taking radio off the air waves and letting you control the station. Then came <a href="http://spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, where whole albums were at your fingertips. Both even one-upped Netflix by offering free options.

Now Apple is on the scene with the launch of their <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/" target="_blank">Apple Music</a> service. Similar to Spotify, but toting an impressive library, it&rsquo;s now easier to listen to what you want when you want for <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/membership/" target="_blank">only $10 a month</a>.

Slowly, I&rsquo;m beginning to realize that I&rsquo;ve become the minority: a person who still pays $1.29 per song or &ndash; gasp &ndash; buys an entire album digitially and sometimes physically.

So why do I still prefer to buy and own my music?

## A Little Math
The first reason is that &ndash; in the long run &ndash; it&rsquo;s cheaper. <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/" target="_blank">Spotify Premium</a> is $9.99 a month, just like Apple Music. That means I&rsquo;d have to purchase eight or more songs a month at $1.29 a piece to make it the less expensive option.

## Less Data
Unlimited data is pretty much a thing of the past and while my two gigabytes a month suffices just well given that I&rsquo;m usually on Wi-Fi, what about when I&rsquo;m driving? Three-fourths of the time, I&rsquo;m listening to music off my phone when I&rsquo;m in my car, and while music isn&rsquo;t as data heavy a video, that would still add up. That means I&rsquo;d need a larger data plan, adding to my monthly cell phone bill.

## Changing Libraries
Since you don&rsquo;t own the music you&rsquo;re listening to on you streaming service of choice, that also means it can &ldquo;disappear&rdquo; at any time. Licenses expire.

This is probably more prevelantly seen with Netflix. Sites like IGN go as far as to post each months what new movies and shows are being added and what are being removed.

I found myself with this problem a couple weeks ago.

I had never seen a <a href="http://www.missionimpossible.com" target="_blank">Mission: Impossible</a> movie and with my friends interested in seeing the latest one coming out that weekend, I sought to catch up on the series. I remembered seeing at least three of the four previous editions on Netflix at one point, but now only M:I and M:I2 were available.

How am I supposed to watch M:I3 or Ghost Protocol? I&rsquo;d either have to go rent them, borrow them or buy them. Two of those three options would make me pay more than my budgetted $7.99 per month for Netflix. (Smart marketing by Paramount, by the way.)

The point is that, since you don&rsquo;t end up owning the title, it&rsquo;s not yours to watch whenever and wherever you are.

## The Tempations to Stream
There are some certain features that streaming services do provide that aren&rsquo;t readily available from other apps like the those built into devices.

For example, I know many friends who like the workout features Spotify provides.

There&rsquo;s also the ability to &ldquo;sample&rdquo; a whole album without purchasing it.

So there are viable reasons to purchase a subscription service, if those features interest you.

## Decision Making
While I may not be ready to jump on the streaming bandwagon, you may have different reasons to subscribe. Let me know what you think below. 

Do you subscribe to a music subscription service? If so, which one and why? 

If you haven&rsquo;t subscribed yet, is there a specific reason?
