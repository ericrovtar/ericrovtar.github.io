Streaming services have taken over the way we all consume media these days. 

It started with <a href="http://netflix.com" target="_blank">Netflix</a> letting us watch thousands of movies on demand without having to leave home. Better yet, we didn&rsquo;t have to worry if a movie was in stock at our local Blockbuster or returning it the next day to avoid more fees. No, for less than $8 a month we had unlimited possibilites anywhere and everywhere.

It&rsquo;s not surprising the music industry followed suit. <a href="http://pandora.com" target="_blank">Pandora Radio</a> was all the rage at first, taking radio off the air waves and letting you control the station. Then came <a href="http://spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, where whole albums were at your fingertips. Both even one-upped Netflix by offering free options with specific limitations.

Now Apple is on the scene with the launch of their <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/" target="_blank">Apple Music</a> service. Similar to Spotify but toting an impressive library, it&rsquo;s now easier to listen to what you want when you want for <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/membership/" target="_blank">only $10 a month</a>.

Slowly, I&rsquo;m beginning to realize that I&rsquo;ve become the minority: a person who still pays $1.29 per song or &ndash; <i>gasp</i> &ndash; buys an entire album digitially and sometimes physically.

So why do I still prefer to buy and own my music?

## A Little Math
The first reason is that &ndash; in the long run &ndash; it&rsquo;s cheaper. <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/" target="_blank">Spotify Premium</a> is $9.99 a month, just like Apple Music. That means I&rsquo;d have to purchase eight or more songs a month at $1.29 a piece to make it the less expensive option.

## Less Data
Unlimited data is pretty much a thing of the past and while my two gigabytes a month suffices just well given that I&rsquo;m usually on Wi-Fi, what about when I&rsquo;m driving? Three-fourths of the time, I&rsquo;m listening to music off my phone when I&rsquo;m in my car, and while music isn&rsquo;t as data heavy a video, that would still add up. That means I&rsquo;d need a larger data plan, adding to my monthly cell phone bill.

Spotify Premium does allow users to download songs for offline playing, so if I were to plan ahead, I could listen to what I wanted in my car. What about when I want to put my iPhone on random, though? I&rdquo;d be limited to the songs or albums I marked for offline play.

## Changing Libraries
Since you don&rsquo;t own the music you&rsquo;re listening to on your streaming service of choice, that also means it can &ldquo;disappear&rdquo; at any time. Licenses expire and change.

This is probably more prevelantly seen with Netflix. Sites like <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/27/heres-whats-leaving-netflix-in-august-2015" target="_blank">IGN</a> go as far as to post each month what new movies and shows are being added and what are being removed.

I found myself with this problem a couple weeks ago.

I had never seen a <a href="http://www.missionimpossible.com" target="_blank">Mission: Impossible</a> movie and with my friends interested in seeing the latest one coming out that weekend, I sought to catch up on the series. I remembered seeing at MI:1 through M:I3 on Netflix at one point, but when I looked now now only M:I and M:I2 were available. <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/26/heres-whats-leaving-netflix-on-december-1" target="_blank">M:I3 had left in December</a>, it seems.

What other options are left to me now? I&rsquo;d either have to go rent, borrow or buy the Blu-Ray. Two of those three options would make me pay more than my budgetted $7.99 per month for Netflix. (This is smart marketing by Paramount, by the way.)

The point is that, since you don&rsquo;t end up owning the title, it&rsquo;s not yours to watch whenever and wherever you are.

## The Tempations to Stream
There are some certain features that streaming services do provide that aren&rsquo;t readily available from other apps like the ones built into devices.

For example, I know many friends who like the workout features Spotify provides and the ability to share playlists with other users.

There&rsquo;s also the ability to &ldquo;sample&rdquo; a whole album without purchasing it, whereas iTunes limits you to only 90 seconds.

So there are viable reasons to purchase a subscription service, if those features interest you.

## Decision Making
While I may not be ready to jump on the streaming bandwagon, you may have different reasons to subscribe.

For those already using a streaming service, which are you using and why? 

If you haven&rsquo;t subscribed yet, is there a specific reason keeping you from doing so? If so, what is it?

Start a discussion below and let&rsquo;s see if I really am in the minority.
