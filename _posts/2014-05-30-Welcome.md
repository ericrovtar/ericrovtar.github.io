I figured it was only appropriate to begin my blog with a post explaining why I'm blogging in the first place. Whether you personally know me or not, I hope this will give you a bit more insight into my intentions.

I've always been fascinated by pop culture. as a child, i often rejected it in some regards, but I went through High School, I began to become enamored with it – the top 40 music, network television and blockbuster movies, New York Times bestsellers.

When I was in college, I began to notice things within all of these things. Any half thought-out story had a bigger message laying beneath it. Sometimes those messages are made plain as day but other times they are a bit more subtle, laying just below the surface, hoping to be spotted.

That's what is fascinating about the arts: their ability to say so much without ever actually needing to articulate it.

These things are what I want to look at on this blog. So whenever I go see a nee movie, catch a line of dialog on TV or see a message in a novel, I hope yo discuss those on here.

That's not to say I won't have random things to say from time to time, but we'll discover those as we go.

I hope you'll join me in this. Follow me on Twitter to stay in the loop (or go old school and subscribe via RSS). Comment at the bottom of any post. I'd love to know what you think.

Thanks for stopping by.
