I remember in High School when my friends and I would exchange Christmas presents. I tried to carefully plan out an item for each of them and before the holiday break, we’d swap them with each other.

I also remember this one time when someone gave me a gift, but I hadn’t gotten them a gift in return. I was quick to feel on uneven footing as this unseen balence shifted beneath me.

What had I done to get this gift? I hadn’t given one in return. It’s a rather uncomfortable situation to be in.

I’m sure we’ve all been there at some point in our lives. Even someone simply texting you happy birthday when you never did the same for them can make you feel belittled and lowly. You may even try to quickly restore balence by making it up somehow.

What is it about getting something you haven’t earned that triggers this sense of remorse, this sense on inadequacy?



<hr />

The concept of what we deserve and what we get is an interesting one, and Mr. Anderson’s response to Charlie is a very intriguing focus on that. 

Charlie is very perceptive. He often sees things about others that they, themselves miss. He observes people and understands them, yet when it comes to Sam and her reasoning for not being with him, he’s lost. 

To Charlie, it’s only logical that Sam should give up Craig for him. The way Craig loves her is nothing compared to how Charlie does, but throughout most of the story, Sam continues to stay with Craig. 

After Charlie confides that he’s never been kissed and Sam lists all the fallacious reasons they cannot be together, she states, “I want to make sure that the first person you kiss loves you,” and proceeds to kiss him. 

This only confuses him more. He can’t logically reason why Sam won’t be with him. She admits she loves him and knows that he loves her, but she remains steadfast that they can’t be together.  

That’s what leads to Charlie’s discussion with Mr. Anderson. And it’s Mr. Anderson who’s able to point out the single reason Sam is choosing Craig over Charlie, the fact that she doesn’t think she deserves Charlie.

“Deserve” is an interesting word. By <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/deserve?s=t" target="_blank">definition</a> it means “to merit, be qualified for, or have a claim to because of actions,” but it’s long become a catchphrase to mask something we want, rather than sometime we’ve earned. We like to hide behind the concept of “deserving something” to justify our desire for it even though we haven’t earned it. 

Mr. Anderson understands this which is why he can explain to Charlie that, in Sam’s case, she doesn’t think she’s worthy of Charlie’s love and is rejecting it, instead opting for something far less but more befitting of the person she sees when looking in the mirror.

“We accept the love we think we deserve.” If we lived our lives with that philosophy applied to everything, I wonder what we’d be left with. After all, what is it we really deserve?

If I’m honest, I know that I don’t deserve much at all, but I also recognize just how much I’ve been given. When I look in the mirror, I often wonder, as Sam does, why would anyone like me? I’m nothing special and I’m definitely more messed up than I let on. I’m eternally flawed, trying to make headway in a world that does nothing but try to cut me down.

There’s one key difference between Sam and myself, though: I accept the gifts I’ve been given but have failed to earn. I know that I don’t deserve them, so I’m thankful for them all the same. I’m thankful for a my job, my house, my car, my friends. I’m grateful for those who love me, even when they don’t have to.

I’m not perfect; I admit that. And no matter how much I try to hide that fact or attempt to correct it, I also know that I’ll never be good enough.

If Charlie were to observe me, he’d see right through me, but he wouldn’t care either. He’d focus on the good parts.

Anyone who has ever wrestled with low self-esteem will probably relate to this rather easily. You begin to feel so lowly about yourself that you can’t justify why anyone else would care enough to be nice to you, let alone love you. 

Most would probably say that low self-esteem is a negative thing – and left unchecked, it can be – but any of us who have dealt with those feelings are simply more in tune with who we are inside. We know that our outside is a façade made to fit in and make other like us, but deep down we also know we don’t deserve those people in our lives because, if they were to really know us – all our faults and weaknesses – they wouldn’t really like us. 

Have you ever thought what it would be like if everyone could read your thoughts? What would they find inside your head? 

I know I’d be freaked out if my thoughts were broadcast to the world or even just to my friends. All the times I’ve had a negative thought about someone or something suddenly broadcast for all to hear. Every fleeting bit of jealousy and envy on full display. A lot of people’s feelings would be hurt. 

I’m willing to bet that I’m not alone in this. Even though some of us keep it hidden really well, our inner thoughts betray us. Sure, they may be passing and easily dismissed, but they were still made, and if the world were to see them all, I doubt we would be liked by very many people. Isn’t is often when we lose control of one of those thoughts and it slips between our lips that the most damage is done?  

If people knew the real you, the one that’s guarded and kept secret, what would they think?

Yet, that’s not often how we live. Instead, we’ve been given so much, so many things that we haven’t earned and by no means deserve. For many of us that comes in the form of a family, a house, a job.

I hope some of you are lucky to realize this and see the world through grateful eyes. Be mindful the next time you start a sentence with “I deserve” and remember how Charlie saw others. Try to see yourself and those around you as he would see you. Even when the world reminds you of what you really deserve, look upward and see all that you still have. 

Even life is simply a gift you never earned.
