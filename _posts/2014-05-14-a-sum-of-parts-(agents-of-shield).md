        A monkey. Thousands and thousands of other beautiful things that were just as terrified to 
        die as we are. We gave them new life &ndash; a good one, I hope. It&rsquo;s fitting we&rsquo;re down here 
        together, Fitz. This is where all life began on our planet, anyway.

You have no idea how hard it was to label the above quote &ldquo;Simmons &amp; Fitz&rdquo; but I had to preserve who said what. Fitz / Simmons are my favorite characters on <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i> Maybe it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re geeky and relate to that part of me, but I think it&rsquo;s more their relationship &ndash; sibling-like, yet teetering on something more &ndash; that makes me want to see what happens next for these two.

All that aside, and since we really won&rsquo;t know what lies ahead for these characters until the fall premiere, the dialog from the Season One finale really struck me.

Sure, we&rsquo;ve all taken physics class in high school, so we&rsquo;re all too familiar with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics" target="_blank">first law of thermodynamics</a>. Even if we don&rsquo;t remember it by name, we at least remember the concept: Energy can be neither created nor destroyed, but can change form.

It&rsquo;s a simple concept really. When you hit a nail with a hammer, you are extending energy that is being transferred into the hammer, then the nail, and finally into whatever the nail is wedging it&rsquo;s way into. Energy is preserved throughout this whole process. If there&rsquo;s excess for some reason or resistance from the wood, then the excess is converted into heat. So while energy can change forms, it remains constant.

Science lesson finished.

I bring this up, not to bore anyone, but to highlight the concept Fitz / Simmons are referring to as they reflect on  impending death. Here are two brilliant minds &ndash; one who specializes in the mechanical and the other in the biological &ndash; trying to wrap their collective minds around something man has been questioning since the dawn of time.

Death, specifically our own eventual death, is not a topic we enjoy talking about, but that makes it no less a reality.

If we&rsquo;re to follow Fitz / Simmons thinking, when we die the energy that makes us up is simply transferred, like the hammer to the nail, and will exist in something else, such as a dragonfish or a microbe.

That seems reasonable enough, doesn&rsquo;t it?

It&rsquo;s easy enough to quickly shout out &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; but if we do, we&rdquo;re missing out on the bigger picture. If we simply answer &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; then we&rsquo;re concluding that all we are is physical. We exist as bones, muscle and tissue, nothing more.

If that&rsquo;s all we are, then what makes us each so unique? What makes me different from you? What makes you different from everyone else in the world?

It&rsquo;s easy to see how Fitz / Simmons can overlook such a fundamental piece of the puzzle. Fitz is so focused on the moving parts and Simmons can&rsquo;t see beyond something&rsquo;s genetic code to realize there&rsquo;s a piece of each of us that isn&rsquo;s so tangible &ndash; our soul.

Sure, we&rsquo;re made up of all these moving parts, intricately pieced together, but our personalities, our souls, bring life to those parts. If they didn&rsquo;t then we&rsquo;d just be robots.

So, while this conversation with Fitz and Simmons was cute and precious, don&rsquo;t miss what they seemed to. We&rsquo;re more than a bundle of energy waiting to be transfered to whatever it touches next. We&rsquo;re also a person who can&rsquo;t be replicated.
