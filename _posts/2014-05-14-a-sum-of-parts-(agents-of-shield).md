        A monkey. Thousands and thousands of other beautiful things that were just as terrified to 
        die as we are. We gave them new life &ndash; a good one, I hope. It&rsquo;s fitting we&rsquo;re down here 
        together, Fitz. This is where all life began on our planet, anyway.

You have no idea how hard it was to label the above quote &ldquo;Simmons &amp; Fitz&rdquo; but my O.C.D. had me preserve the order of who said what. Fitz / Simmons are my favorite characters on <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i> Maybe it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re geeky and that part of me relates easily to them, but I think it&rsquo;s more their relationship &ndash; sibling-like, yet teetering on something more &ndash; that makes me want to see what happens next for these two. It&rsquo;s the will-they / won&rsquo;t-they effect.

All that aside, and since we really won&rsquo;t know what lies ahead for these characters until the fall premiere, this dialog between them from the Season One finale really struck me. Here they are, stranded together on the ocean floor, no hope for survival, lamenting on what&rsquo;s to become of them.

It&rsquo;s a dire scene, yet the writers manage to dive deep into what makes these two characters tick and give us insight into how they view life.

Simmons leads in by applying the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics" target="_blank">first law of thermodynamics</a>. I know this isn&rsquo;t a physics lesson, but just to be clear, even if you don't recall it by name, you probably remember the concept: Energy can be neither created nor destroyed.

So what Simmons is reflecting on is that, when they die, their energy won't die with them, but rather it will be transferred out of their bodies, potentially reaching other lifeforms. It's a really nice sentiment.

The thing is, energy is energy. Sure, it comes in different forms &ndash; kinetic, potential, etc. &ndash; but energy isn't unique to any one individual. We don't even create our own energy. &ldquo;Energy is neither created nor destroyed,&rdquo; remember? So any energy we have has been passed along from something else &ndash; the food we eat, for example.

Simmons, being a bio-chem specialist, obviously understands this as the final part of her statement shows: &ldquo;And every part of us now was once a part of some other thing. I mean, a storm cloud, a mammoth&hellip;&rdquo;

So then what&rsquo;s really sentimental about any of this? If energy is the only thing we leave behind and it wasn't ours to begin with, who cares?

Our physical bodies no longer exist. Our <i>borrowed</i> energy has been returned. What&rsquo;s so sentimental about returning something that never belonged to us?

Here they are, expecting these to be their final moments, and they reflect on how something that was never really there's will still live on after they die? It seems rather depressing to be honest, because if that's the only thing to happen, then what's the point?

It would seem that everything we once were is now gone.

Being so focused on the physical, they&rsquo;ve left out a very important part, though. We&rsquo;re more than just physical creatures because otherwise we'd only be a bunch of pieces and parts thrown together.







Fitz and Simmons excel in analyzing and understanding the physical. As Fitz put it in the pilot episode, &ldquo;[he&rsquo;s] engineering; she&rsquo;s bio-chem.&rdquo; Both are great scientists who are able to look at how physical parts &ndash; whether they&rsquo;re mechanical or biological &ndash; fit and work together. So when they think about life, they think about the tangible parts that make it up.


Is that all that we are, though?

If the answer is &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; then what makes us each so unique? What makes me different from you? What makes you different from everyone else in the world?

Fitz / Simmons are so focused on the physical that they don&rsquo;t realize there&rsquo;s a piece of each of us that isn&rsquo;s tangible &ndash; our soul.

Sure, we&rsquo;re made up of all these moving parts, intricately pieced together, but our personalities, our souls, bring life to those parts. If they didn&rsquo;t then we&rsquo;d just be robots.

It&rsquo;s a simple concept really. When you hit a nail with a hammer, you are extending energy that is being transferred into the hammer, then the nail, and finally into whatever the nail is wedging it&rsquo;s way into. Energy is preserved throughout this whole process. If there&rsquo;s excess for some reason or resistance from the wood, then the excess is converted into heat. So while energy can change forms, it remains constant.

Science lesson finished.

I bring this up, not to bore anyone, but to highlight the concept Fitz / Simmons are referring to as they reflect on  impending death. Here are two brilliant minds &ndash; one who specializes in the mechanical and the other in the biological &ndash; trying to wrap their collective minds around something man has been questioning since the dawn of time.

Death, specifically our own eventual death, is not a topic we enjoy talking about, but that makes it no less a reality.

If we&rsquo;re to follow Fitz / Simmons thinking, when we die the energy that makes us up is simply transferred, like the hammer to the nail, and will exist in something else, such as a dragon fish or a microbe.

That seems reasonable enough, doesn&rsquo;t it?

It&rsquo;s easy enough to quickly shout out &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; but if we do, we&rdquo;re missing out on the bigger picture. If we simply answer &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; then we&rsquo;re concluding that all we are is physical. We exist as bones, muscle and tissue, nothing more.

If that&rsquo;s all we are, then what makes us each so unique? What makes me different from you? What makes you different from everyone else in the world?

It&rsquo;s easy to see how Fitz / Simmons can overlook such a fundamental piece of the puzzle. Fitz is so focused on the moving parts and Simmons can&rsquo;t see beyond something&rsquo;s genetic code to realize there&rsquo;s a piece of each of us that isn&rsquo;s so tangible &ndash; our soul.

Sure, we&rsquo;re made up of all these moving parts, intricately pieced together, but our personalities, our souls, bring life to those parts. If they didn&rsquo;t then we&rsquo;d just be robots.

So, while this conversation with Fitz and Simmons was cute and precious, don&rsquo;t miss what they seemed to. We&rsquo;re more than a bundle of energy waiting to be transfered to whatever it touches next. We&rsquo;re also a person who can&rsquo;t be replicated.
