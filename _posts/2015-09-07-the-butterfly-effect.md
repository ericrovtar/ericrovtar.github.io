&ldquo;A tiny butterfly flapping its wings today may lead to a devastating hurricane weeks from now.&rdquo;

When you look at your life, you begin to see a series of moments in your past that have taken you to the point you&rsquo;re at today. But what if one of those moments hadn&rsquo;t occurred? What if you&rsquo;d made a different choice?

Would you have ended up in the same place?

It&rsquo;s hard to say, but interesting to speculate. I know that there are distinct moments in my past that &ndash; together &ndash; set me on the path to where I am today.

What if I&rsquo;d stayed at Ohio State? What if I hadn&rsquo;t gone on that trip? What if I&rsquo;d never known ____?

The concept of choice is the core game mechanic in <a href="http://www.supermassivegames.com/" target="_target">Supermassive</a>&rsquo;s <i>Until Dawn</i> on Playstation 4. You play through a teen horror movie, making choices as you go where every choice you make helps determine if one of eight characters does or doesn&rsquo;t survive until dawn. Every probable outcome is potentially possible &ndash; every character can die, every character survive and any combination in between.

When I played, only two ended up surviving. One of which I tried my best to kill off because &ndash; frankly &ndash; she is just a b*&$h. It&rsquo;s this so-called &ldquo;butterfly effect&rdquo; mechanic where the game definitely excels (and it doesn&rsquo;t hurt that characters are a bit self-aware of it as well).

Once an important choice is made, the game alerts you that a butterfly effect has occurred and in the menu you can see the through-line of these choices. One choice leads to a different outcome later in the game or modifies your relationship with a different character.

All of these different points make up your story, a story unique to you because it&rsquo;s defined by your choices, much as it is in real life.

When you look back at your life, what are the moments that standout as turning points? What moments had a butterfly effect that helped take you to where you are today? If you changed one of them, how might your life be better or worse?

Ultimately, I know it does&rsquo;t matter. The past is the past, and we can&rsquot change it, but it&rsquo;s still fun to speculate, so let me know your answers in the comments below.
