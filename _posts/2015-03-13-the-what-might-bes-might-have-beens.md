As I&rsquo;ve grown older, I&rsquo;ve undoubtedly made more choices in my life. Decisions like <i>which college I would attend?</i>, <i>who would I ask to prom?</i> and <i>what should I make for dinner?</i> all fall to the past as time moves me forward.

Sure, some choices aren&rsquo;t monumental &ndash; some I don&rsquo;t even recall making &ndash; but ultimately they all culminated in my being where I am today.

It&rsquo;s easy to look back and wonder what my life would be had I made a different choice. What if I&rsquo;d chosen Miami University over Ohio State? What if I had asked Mary instead of Lisa? How different would my life look today had one of these things been different?

Obviously, all I can do is speculate, but this is the concept <i>If/Then</i> toys with: showing you Beth&rsquo;s (Idina Menzel) life in multiple ways, both distinct based on choices she could have made different.

Whenever I find myself wondering how different my life would be if I had done something differently in the past, it&rsquo;s easy to get lost &ldquo;might-have-been&rsquo;s.&rsquo; Still, there&rsquo;s no way to be sure. Perhaps I&rsquo;d be in the same exact place I am today or maybe it&rsquo;d only be slightly altered.

Yet, when I start to think of all the things I have and am grateful for, it&rsquo;s hard to not look back and recognize that I have those things because of the choices I made because, despite how hard we try, the past isn&rsquo;t malleable. We can&rsquo;t change it, even though glimpses of it linger in our minds calling to question the &ldquo;might-have-been&rsquo;s.&rdquo;

Had I not gone to Ohio State, I wouldn&rsquo;t have ended up transferring to Kent State. I wouldn&rsquo;t have made the friends at Kent that changed my life, and I most certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have the job I do today.

So it&rsquo;s funny how the sequence of our lives plays out. It&rsquo;s a grand story unfolding right before us, and while it&rsquo;s fun to think of how my life could or might be different, it&rsquo;s ultimately those things in my life that I hold dear that pull me back. Those are the things that remind me that, even though the &ldquo;might-have-been&rsquo;s&rdquo; remain dangling in my past, it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;what-might-be&rsquo;s&rdquo; that I need to stay focused on.
