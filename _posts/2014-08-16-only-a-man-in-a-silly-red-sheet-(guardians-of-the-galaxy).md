I suppose, like most children, I used to pretend to be my favorite superheroes. First, there was Batman, then Spider-man. Throw in some Lion-O and TMNT and you can tell one thing for sure: I was a child of the 80’s.

Regardless, I spent hours trying to be something more than I saw myself being, and – if I’m honest – I still dream about that. There’s something inherently engrained in men to want to save the world, to exceed themselves.

In Marvel’s <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>, we see a rag-tag group form out of necessity to ultimately stop a power they can barely conceive. Thrown together by circumstance, they don’t have to continue the race they run from planet to planet, but they do, and it’s the group’s leader Peter Quill (known by fewer than he’d like as “Star-Lord”) who points out why he doesn’t simply walk away after being pressed by Rocket.

He cares too much. He sees that if he doesn’t do it, who will? He’s invested.

So here you have a man, taken from his family and home 20-some years ago, having grown up among a group of outlaws, that now claims to be the galaxy's most infamous outlaw become the hero who saves the galaxy that seems to have mostly forsaken him. He doesn’t have any super powers (well&hellip; none we’re 100% certain of yet). He barely has any friends, but he becomes the hero the galaxy needs him to be.

There are times when I want nothing more than to “save” my friends, either from themselves or whatever situation they’ve found themselves in. I’ll do anything I can to help, sometimes to my own detriment.

You’ve already heard about <a href="/2014/05/17/fighting-for-control-(godzilla-2014)">my struggle to control things</a>, and I’m sure that plays a huge part in this, except here it’s an external presentation. Still, I simply long to help.

I’m still that kid wanting to be Superman, who hasn’t learned that he’s really “only a man in a silly red sheet.”

Maybe I haven’t grown up as much as I need to, or maybe I’m unrealistic, but there’s still a part of me that strives to be something more than I am. I want to have an impact. I want my chance save the galaxy.

If or when that day comes, I hope I’m up to the challenge.
