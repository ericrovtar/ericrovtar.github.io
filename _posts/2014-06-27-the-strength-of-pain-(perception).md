<i>Perception</i> may not be the best acted or written show on television, and it may never win any awards, but it’s a show I enjoy watching. Others must too as it now enters it’s third season on <a href="http://tntdrama.com" target="_blank">TNT</a>.

It’s the psychological aspect of the show that keeps me intrigued. The main character Dr. Daniel Pierce is a paranoid schizophrenic neuropsychiatrist who teaches at a Chicago university. He just so happens to assist the local FBI office weekly due to a former student of his being a detective. (Yes, it’s not the most plausible show ever.)

Pierce has this ability to analyze and assess situations that always lead him to solving cases that no one else can. Usually it’s through the assist of one of his delusions, which often brings a bit of subtle humor to the series.

In this past week’s episode, we found the good doctor identifying a victim with the medical condition <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_analgesia" target="_blank">congenital analgesia</a>, a rare genetic disorder that causes a person to have no sensation or feeling to physical pain.

True to form, this new case coincides with Pierce having just been dumped. Everyone in his life keeps asking if he’s okay, and like most of us, he doesn’t respond openly when asked. He tries to push people away because doing so also allows him to push any emotional pain away as well.

The theme of the episode is pretty set: What’s life like when you’re unable – or unwilling – to experience and process pain?

Let’s stick with the concept of physical pain for a moment. What would it be like if you had congenital analgesia and were completely unable to feel anything, including pain?

Think about that for a minute. If someone punched you – whether provoked or not – you could stand there like Superman as if it didn’t phase you at all. Anytime you needed a shot, you wouldn’t have to squirm waiting for the prick of the needle because you’d never feel it. This condition could be seen as beneficial.

But wait, you could accidentally touch a hot stove top and seriously burn your hand but never know it. You could cut yourself and bleed for hours until you finally realized there was blood everywhere.

Some unique life problems begin to present themselves that make us realize that this wouldn’t be an easy condition to live with. You would constantly have to monitor yourself and have someone’s help.

So wait&hellip; pain – at least physical pain – serves a purpose. Pain serves as a mirro to the other emotions of life, as Dr. Pierce points out: 

<blockquote>
    <p>
        “The more we know pain in all it’s varying flavors, the more we can appreciate the sensations and feelings that we like. That’s the nature of a contrast. If we never felt bitterness or anger, then we wouldn’t deeply appreciate our happiness. And if we never knew fear, we couldn’t admire courage.”
    </p>

Our pain makes us recognize the better parts of life. It makes us stronger. Think back to some defining moments in your past. Were they scary at the time? Were they hard? Didn’t those times help make you stronger?

Have you ever watched a baby transition into a toddler? If you haven’t you’re missing out because it’s rather entertaining, but that’s not the point. The point is that, as a baby learns to first stand and take his or her first step, that baby will not get it right each time. He or she will fall, cry and give up, but eventually – and with prodding from the adults waiting for that precious moment – he or she will get back up and try again.

To the baby, this is a painful process. I assume so at least, because there is usually crying involved. Still, he or she doesn’t give up and he or she presses through the pain. The end result is learning to walk.

As adults, our pain and struggles often don’t seem quite as simple, but we all must still deal with the pain all the same. That’s something that is truly universal.

Sometimes we may choose to wallow in it and give up because we lose site of what it can teach us, of how it can strengthen us. If we do that, then we’re missing out on the larger opportunity for growth. All too often, we’ll let the darker side of pain hold us back. We’ll stay angry out of our own egotism. We’ll stay afraid because it’s easier.

Have you ever tried to stay angry at someone? It’s not easy, is it? As time continues to pass, your anger tends to fade, but your determination can continue to drag it out. Still, after a while, it begins to take more energy to maintain your anger than it would to move past it.

In my life, I’ve had to say goodbye to quite a few people and each time it’s been hard. The pain of loss caused me to become sad and angry at God for taking someone I cared about way too soon according to my own calculations.

My last surviving grandfather passed away over three years ago. He had been diagnosed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease" target="_blank">Alzheimer’s</a> and mentally had left us years prior to physically. Towards the end, we knew it wouldn’t be long until he died. I remember the day before when he was alive but asleep, only to wake long enough for the hospice nurse to turn him from one side to the next. We knew it would be soon.

I went to bed that evening, knowing that at any moment I could be awoken to hear it was time. That happened before the sun came up. My parents had gotten the call and we rushed to the nursing home. He had finally passed away.

We knew it was coming. We knew we couldn’t stop it. But as we entered his room to see his lifeless body laying there, I couldn't help but weep. (Even now I’m struggling to not cry as I recall that day.) It didn’t make sense. I knew this day was coming. I knew that the grandfather I remembered had long since passed, but still, I couldn’t help but feel sad.

You know what that sadness taught me, though? It taught me how to appreciate the time we do have. It taught me to be grateful for the joy, laughter and happiness we get to experience with others as we walk through life.

Think back to the baby. What expression is on their face as the adults cheer after taking that first step? Joy results from a constant struggle.

The pain of loss is something we all must face at one point or another in our lives. While it may appear to be easier for some of us than others, it’s still a pain that we must endure.

I wasn’t the only one who weeped that day. My dad and the rest of my family all were in pain over the loss of someone with whom we’d accumulated many fond memories.

Pain isn’t something that can be out run. While none of us ever go looking for pain, it will still find us.

You, like everyone else, have stories of pain from your past. You also have stories that have yet to be written, stories that will leave you in tears. You may try to avoid them. You may try to stay numb, but they will happen and you have a choice on how to respond to them when they do.

The next time you find yourself in pain from loss or from having a bad day or from whatever, I hope you remember what Dr. Pierce has said because it will remind you of what’s on the other side of that struggle:

<blockquote>
    <p>
        “&hellip;to more fully enjoy the beauty in our lives, we must acknowledge and embrace our pain.”
    </p>
