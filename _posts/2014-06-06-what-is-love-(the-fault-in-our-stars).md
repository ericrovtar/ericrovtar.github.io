If you’ve seen the trailers for the movie, you probably think “The Fault In Our Stars” is just another “chick flick.” If that’s you’re initial assumption, I challenge you to read the book. John Green has such a unique way of taking the traditional coming of age story, twisting it and then using it to analyze different facets of life. 

That’s what we see in this scene as Hazel, a terminally ill cancer patient, dialogs with Isaac, one of her only friends and a cancer survivor. Isaac’s longterm girlfriend just dumped him after he received news that his cancer had returned. Understandably upset and trying to come to terms with how someone who once confessed her love for him can leave in his time of need, Isaac hits on a something most of us take too long to understand. 

Like most people, I grew up hearing the fairy tales where the attractive prince falls in love with the equally attractive princess at first sight. We consider it romantic as the prince then tries to rescue the princess as a testament of their true love. 

Without even being told to, I quickly began to expect love to be like that, waiting for this overly romantic moment where I would “fall” in love and know it beyond a doubt. She would feel the same way and instantly we’d be together forever so we could live happily ever after. 

Throughout high school and college, I kept waiting for that moment. I’d even go so far as to try to force that perfect moment to happen, only to see it never work out the way I wanted it to, and too often missing the opportunity all together. 

I’d try to find the right moment to ask a girl out, playing it over and over in my head, knowing exactly what I would say and how she would reply. 

I was naïve. Real life doesn’t work that way. Things are never as I picture them in my head. The words never come out as clearly as I planned them. (Most of the time I slip into my best impression of an inarticulate man anyway, and I know how attractive that is.) 

Needless to say, I didn’t have much luck dating, but I digress…. 

It took me a long time to realize the truth about love – longer than it took Isaac. 

True love isn’t this mystical thing we all search for, waiting for that special moment to occur. True love is what we make of it. You see, love isn’t really about an emotion or attraction. It’s about a choice, a choice to commit to someone by putting them and their needs above your own. 

Now, I’m not trying to totally negate emotion and attraction. I do believe it’s healthy and plays a part, but the underlying aspect of love we all miss is that to love someone means to choose to love them every single day. 

<!--- 
That’s the promise a couple makes at a wedding ceremony. They promise to put the other person first, thinking and caring for their needs prior to worrying about their own. 
---> 

All too often, we forget this and love becomes more about what we can get out of the relationship rather than what we can give to it, and when that happens – when we choose to not put the other person first – things begin to fall apart. 

<!--- 
Have you ever done that? Have you ever caught yourself being more concerned with what you need or want than what the person you’re claiming to “love” needs or wants? 
---> 

We’ve all been there. It’s a learning experience, after all, and in any long-term relationship, we’re all bound to make mistakes. It doesn’t matter if we’re talking about a family member, friend or significant other, it’s hard for us to choose to love others, to put them first. 

Try to think about this as you interact with other people this week. Try to put their needs above your own. See what happens.  

It won’t be easy, that’s for certain, but if you make that choice, if you promise to love others, something will change and people will notice.  

In the end, you’ll find yourself becoming more attractive than you’ve ever been. Now that’s a promise.
