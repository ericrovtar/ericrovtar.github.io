##You Got It, Dude
It&rsquo;s been really entertaining to see how many of my friends on Twitter and Facebook are sharing their
binges of Netflix&rsquo;s Fuller House.

Cashing in the on 90&rsquo;s nostalgia, Netflix has revived a show every family watched on Friday nights for
many years. Full House still airs to this day on Nick @ Nite, so there is obviously still an audience out there
that cares about the Tanner clan and might be open to revisiting these characters 20-some years later.

##Oh, Mylanta
Personally, I don&rsquo;t think the original series translates well to a modern audience. The rising violins
(as Uncle Jesse points out in Fuller House) to highlight a neat bow being tied on a life lesson simplify life
in a way that people aren&rsquo;t ignorant to in today&rsquo;s culture.

I wondered how this sequel series would deal with that. Obviously, it wants to pay homage to it&rsquo;s
heritage, but it will also want to try and reach a new audience of families growing up in 2016.

##Cut It Out
Ultimately, Fuller House is strongest when it keeps the nostaliga to a minimum and weakest when it won&rsquo;t
let go of its past.

Most episodes have a guest star from the original cast, which only serves to distract from the new cast.
Further, the visiting actor usually doesn&rsquo;t play any key role in the half-hour story.

When the show focuses on its new core cast of stars &ndash; DJ, Stephanie, Kimmy and the kids &ndash; it&rsquo;s
actually an enjoyable sitcom.

##Do It Gibbler Style
While on the subject, props to the creaters for allowing this to still be a sitcom. Too many of our comedies
these days are centered around one-liners. The situation comedy is a dying art, but it&rsquo;s also something
that allows a show to be timeless.

Having seen all 13 episodes now in just over 24 hours, I can&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t enjoy them. It was fun to
revisit characters I cared about as a kid. It was also interesting to see the show center on the adults in a
different way from the original (when it allowed itself time to do so)

So what did you think? Have you been watching Fuller House this weekend? Is it everything you wanted it to be?
Were you hoping for more? 

Do you want more Fuller House? Or was this one season enough to satisfy your nostalgia?
