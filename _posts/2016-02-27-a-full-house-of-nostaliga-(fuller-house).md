##You Got It, Dude

It&rsquo;s been really entertaining to see how many of my friends on Twitter and Facebook are sharing their
binges of Netflix&rsquo;s Fuller House.

Cashing in the on 90&rsquo;s nostalgia, Netflix has revived a show every family watched on Friday nights for
many years. Full House still airs to this day on Nick @ Nite, so there is obviously still an audience out there
that cares about the Tanner clan and might be open to revisiting these characters 20-some years later.

##Oh, Mylanta

Personally, I don&rsquo;t think the original series translates well to a modern audience. The rising violins
(as Uncle Jesse points out in Fuller House) to highlight a neat bow being tied on a life lesson simplify life
in a way that people aren&rsquo;t ignorant to in today&rsquo;s culture.

I wondered how this sequel series would deal with that. Obviously, it wants to pay homage to it&rsquo;s
heritage, but it will also want to try and reach a new audience of families growing up in 2016.

##Cut It Out

Ultimately, Fuller House is strongest when it keeps the nostaliga to a minimum and weakest when it won&rsquo;t
let go of its past.

Most episodes have a guest star from the original cast, which only serves to distract from the new cast.
Further, the visiting actor usually doesn&rsquo;t play any key role in the half-hour story.

When the show focuses on its new core cast of stars &ndash; DJ, Stephanie, Kimmy and the kids &ndash; it&rsquo;s
actually an enjoyable sitcom.

##Do It Gibbler Style

While on the subject, props to the creaters for allowing this to still be a sitcom. Too many of our comedies
these days are centered around one-liners. The situation comedy is a dying art, but it&rsquo;s also something
that allows a show to be timeless.

Having seen all 13 episodes now in just over 24 hours, I can&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t enjoy them. It was fun to
revisit characters I cared about as a kid. It was also interesting to see the show center on the adults in a
different way from the original (when it allowed itself time to do so)
