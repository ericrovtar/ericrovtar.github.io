## Yo Ho!

Jack Sparrow is a household name, thanks to the likes of Johnny Depp. With the fifth installment in the franchise coming late this May, I wanted to revisit the first three films (and the fourth, if I find a way to stream it). 

You can take the voyage with me and follow along with my thoughts below as I live tweet one film each night:

* Wed.: Curse of the Black Pearl
* Thurs: Dead Man&rsquo;s Chest
* Fri.: At World&rsquo;s End
