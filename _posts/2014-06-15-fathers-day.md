When I first conceived this website, I never imagined I&rsquo;d be quoting Chris Rock, let alone in my third post, yet here I am. I've spent the better part of the past week trying to decide what to write about Father&rsquo;s Day (it seemed appropriate to write something at least), but when I read this quote, I realized that Chris Rock hit on a something I think is really important.

I&rsquo;m not a father, so I won&rsquo;t pretend to be, and I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to have some strong father figures in my life &ndash; both biological and relational. 

My dad was as busy as any other dad. He taught all day and coached at night, so he was busy, but he still made time to be there for my sister and me. He would coach our little league teams, show up to school functions and come home and rough house with us despite being tired.

I was lucky. I know that. I&rsquo;ve seen many situations where the dad has to travel and finds it hard to be there for his kids. It&rsquo;s not because he doesn&rsquo;t want to be, it&rsquo;s just the demands of his job.

Worse yet, I&rsquo;ve seen homes where the father is completely absent. Most of the time this is by choice, sometimes it&rsquo;s by design, but regardless of the scenario, it&rsquo;s sad to see.

That&rsquo;s why Rock&rsquo;s quote stood out so much to me. There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;busy&rdquo; man. We hear enough times just how crazy a celebrity&rsquo;s life can be with complicated schedules and traveling. Still, here he is recognizing that there is something more important than his career and that he would never sacrafice his children for his career.

Sadly, this mentality seems hard to find sometimes in today&rsquo;s world. Everything seems to try and tell us that we should do what&rsquo;s right for us, without regard to what&rsquo;s best for the other people in our lives. Unfortunately, this exists when it comes to adults putting their own needs above those of their children as well.

This past week I met a ten year old who has been in foster care for many years. Here&rsquo;s a child who never asked to be born, but thankfully was. Whether his parents planned for that outcome or not, it doesn't matter because it happened. And now there&rsquo;s a young boy who's trying to make it through life without his bilogical parents. I don&rsquo;t know the whole story, but I know that he exists, that he is a person with feelings and a desire to be loved.

Nothing breaks my heart more than to see situations like this. The child didn&rsquo;t ask for this life, and whether or not his parents planned to have a child, they did. The situation is no longer about them, but about this life they created.

Think about all of the couples that would gladly have a child, but can&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s a cruel irony in the fact that they often realize what a blessing it would be more so than others. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s those people who commit to picking up the slack for those who can&rsquo;t focus on anything but their own wants.

So today as we celebrate our fathers, let&rsquo;s especially reflect on the sacrifices they&rsquo;ve made for us. They had a choice, like we all do, but they chose to put our needs above their own, even in ways we may never know about.

Dads, thanks for doing that. Thanks for being there. Thanks for the advice and wisdom. Thanks for the cash you snuck us even though we didn&rsquo;t earn it. Thanks for life.
