##Transitions Well from Page to Screen

Having read the book, I'm always nervous my favorite parts will be changed to "fit the film." That's not really the case with The Martian.

While changes were made and certain plot points glossed over or omitted, the pacing of the movie felt right at home to the novel.

Likewise, Damon's Watney maintains his emotional nods of grief and worry to sarcastic smart-ass. In fact, the movie even cleverly includes some of the adult dialog in a way that doesn't push it into a higher rating. 

Perhaps the biggest change, which seems to have been added to add the climatic conclusion, is a reworking of the finale. I suppose I understand the changes, but it seemed a bit more science-fiction than the rest of the grounded story. 

By comparison, the added epilogue helps bring closure the book doesn't necessarily. We're able to see what becomes of this team we've invested in for a couple hours, which essentially ties the bow on the story in a nice way.

Definitely one to see in theaters.
