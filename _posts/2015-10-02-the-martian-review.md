##From Page to Screen
Having read the book, I&rsquo;m always nervous my favorite parts will be changed to &ldquo;fit the film.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not really the case with <i>The Martian</i>.

While changes were made and certain plot points glossed over or omitted, the pacing of the movie felt right at home to the novel. True to it&rsquo;s serialized roots, you&rsquo;re instantly thrown into the story and taken along for a ride that makes the 687 day mission by in a flash.

##Capturing the Humanity
Perhaps the biggest apprehension going into the film was: could Matt Damon, known for playing the straight man, appropriately capture the sarcasm and humor of the novel. Quickly, this question is put to rest as Damon&rsquo;s Watney balances his emotional nods of grief and worry to smart-ass and is laugh-out-loud funny. 

In fact, the movie cleverly includes some of the adult dialog in a way that doesn&rsquo;t push it into a higher rating.

##Changes
Perhaps the biggest change, which seems to have been added for a slightly more climatic conclusion, is a reworking of the finale. I suppose I understand the changes, but it seemed a bit more science-fiction than the rest of the grounded story.

By comparison, the added epilogue helps bring closure the book doesn&rsquo;t necessarily. We&rsquo;re able to see what becomes of this team we&rsquo;ve been invested in for a couple hours, which essentially ties the bow on the story in a nice way, whereas the book had a more sudden end that left me thinking I was missing a few pages.

##Conclusion
Overall, this is science-fiction at it&rsquo;s best. While remaining grounded and practical the process of Watney&rsquo;s struggle to survive isolated and alone without proper support on a barren planet is a great depiction of the human spirit to surmount any obsticle at all costs.

Accompanied by visually stunning effects, you&rsquo;ll quickly forget that this wasn&rsquo;t actually filmed on Mars making this movie definitely one to see in theaters.

##The Score
4 out of 5
