## A Journey of Chi

Like many, I&rsquo;m going to spend the weekend binging the latest Netflix / Marvel series Iron Fist. Will it live up to the likes of Daredevil and Jessica Jones? Will it fall flat? How will it setup The Defenders?

Join me, won&rsquo;t you?

## Wrap Up
Iron Fist ultimately falls very short of the high standards its predecesors set. The plot is meandering, the writing weak at best and a lead that can&rsquo;t handle the shoes he&rsquo;s been asked to fill.

There are inklings of something greater here. Unfortunately, the powers that be weren&rsquo;t equipped to bring them to fruition.

## The Score
<span class="h1">2.5</span> / 5
