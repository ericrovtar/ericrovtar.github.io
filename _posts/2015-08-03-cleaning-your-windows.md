When you grow up, there seem to be these pillar moments in history where the whole world stops and focuses on one thing. Memories of the new millenium and Y2K stick vividly in my mind. The media encompasses these events, highlighting them as the whole world watches.

One other example I remember seeing headlines about was the launch of Windows 95. People lined up for a midnight release to have the latest and greated version of Microsoft's operating system. They could wait to experience the "revolutionary" start menu and better multitasking design.

In a day where midnight releases have become and everyday event, this probably doesn't seem like a big deal, but on August 24, 1995 it was "Tonight at 11" material.

It's be almost 20 years later for us to see Microsoft put so much effort behind marketing a new version, but with the launch of Windows 10 it's hard to no witness product placement or advertisements in your everyday life.

As with any 

================

There always seem to be a lot of questions surrounding the release of a new operating system. Why is it different? Should I upgrade? Why should I care? 

This past week, Microsoft released the next major version of Windows. Deemed "the best Windows ever," can it live up to the hype?

Admittedly, Apple has been winning the marketting battle for a while. The "I'm a Mac. I'm a PC." campaign still resonates, making Apple the "cooler" product.

To be fair, Windows has often focused on appealing the business world more. In fact, that's how PCs originally "won" out over Apple back in the 90's: while Apple gave huge discounts to educational institutions, they began to realize that students needed to know how to use Windows when it came time to join the working world.

But in a world where technologies are converging quickly, how does a company like Microsoft appeal to a wider audience? Further, they have combat years of choosing to doing things their own way rather than complying with other standards. Internet Explorer is a great example of this. Until the latest version of IE, Microsoft seemed to no care if their browser was compliant with standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the group who basically says "this is how the internet will work." 

I grew up using Apple II computers. I remember getting our first Apple IIgs and marveling over the 3.5" floppy drive that could auto-eject. (How was such technology possible?)

In middle school we had our first PC, a Packard Bell. The world of interactive CD-ROMs was now open to me
