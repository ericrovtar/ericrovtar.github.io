## iOS 8

On it’s surface, iOS 8 isn’t the shiny coat of paint that iOS 7 was, but beauty isn’t skin deep. Below the surface are some radical changes, entering the operating system into a new era of sophistication.

### App Extensions
The most exciting feature is the ability for apps to integrate with features outside of themselves. For those unfamiliar, before now apps were stuck living in a “sandbox.” All that means is that they were self contained and couldn’t interact with each other.

App Extensions tears down those walls.

One of my favorite apps is Pocket, an app that let’s you save web pages so you can easily index them and view them later. Until now, it was up to other apps to implement a way to save to Pocket, which apps like IGN and TweetBot did, but with iOS 8, the Pocket app itself integrates into the Share screen. This means that, wherever you can click the share button, you can send that item to Pocket just as you would text it to a friend or tweet it.

### Notifications Extensions

### Keyboards
People like customization. I find that customization usually leads to clumsy visuals and unforseen complications.

iOS allows apps to include third-party keyboards that can then be used globally throughout. I tried a couple and didn't immediately take to any. The original is still the best.

To be fair, I didn’t try any that weren’t free and you get what you pay for, but since this feature holds no interest for me, something is going to have to impress me a lot to even drop 99&cent;
