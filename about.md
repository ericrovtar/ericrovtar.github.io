            Hello There
        </p>

        <article class="post-content">
            <p>
                My name&rsquo;s Eric and I like to write &ndash; just not about myself, so I&rsquo;ll keep this short.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You&rsquo;ve found my blog. I try to write posts regularly or as I think of them. Primarily, I like to 
                write about pop culture and ways that truths are tucked away within tv, movies, music and books.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then there are the times that I&rsquo;ll opt to write thoughts about something random I&rsquo;ve
                learned or stumbled upon while online. After all, they say &ldquo;sharing is caring.&rdquo;
            </p>

            <p>
                By day I work in communications, specifically web development and information technology. At night, 
                I like to drink coffee, hang out with friends, read, watch tv, and other stuff normal people do.
                (That&rsquo;s not to say I&rsquo;m &ldquo;normal,&rdquo; mind you.)
            </p>
