<p>
    Hey! My name&rsquo;s Eric and I like to write &ndash; just not about myself. You've found my blog. I try to 
    write posts regularly or as I think of them. Primarily, I like to write about pop culture and ways that truths 
    are tucked away within tv, movies, music and books.
</p>

<p>
    By day I work in communications, specifically web development and information technology. At night, I like to drink 
    coffee, hang out with friends, read, watch tv, and other stuff normal people do. (That&rsquo;s not to say I'm 
    &ldquo;normal,&rdquo; mind you.
</p>

    If you like what I have to say, feel free to find me on 
    <a href="http://facebook.com/eric.rovtar" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and 
    <a href="http://twitter.com/ericrovtar" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, or if you prefer, shoot me an 
    <a href="mailto:eric.rovtar@me.com">email</a>.
